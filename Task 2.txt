1  Set Up Flask: First, install Flask if you haven't already (pip install Flask). Then, create a Python file for your web application.
2 HTML Form: Create an HTML form where users can enter their Name, Gender, and Blood Group.
3 Backend Processing: Write Python code to process the form submission, use the provided healthcare data to determine the medical condition the user is at most risk, and store the user data in a separate CSV or JSON file.
4.Return Result: After processing the form submission, return the result to the user, showing the medical condition they are at most risk.


code :- 
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify
import pandas as pd

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load healthcare data
healthcare_data = pd.read_csv("Healthcare_Data.csv")  # Update with actual filename and path

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
def submit():
    name = request.form['name']
    gender = request.form['gender']
    blood_group = request.form['blood_group']
